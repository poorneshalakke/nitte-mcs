            <p>The dailies? You know -- milk, bread, eggs -- the dailies. These are the things
               you eat that you find yourself running out each week (or each day) to purchase. Now, you spend a lot of money on these
               purchases because of their purchasing frequency, so its important that something worth

      <p>
        Almost all organic farming systems rely on what some call
        alternative farming methods, such as crop rotation, mechanical
        cultivation, animal manures, green manure, and integrated pest
        management to maintain healthy soil, grow healthy plants, and
        control pests and weeds.
