            The dailies? You know -- milk, bread, eggs -- the dailies. These are
            the things you eat that you find yourself running out each week (or
            each day) to purchase. Now, you spend a lot of money on these
            purchases because of their purchasing frequency, so its important
            that something worth so much money is chosen carefully.

            Almost all organic farming systems rely on what some call
            alternative farming methods, such as crop rotation, mechanical
            cultivation, animal manures, green manure, and integrated pest
            management to maintain healthy soil, grow healthy plants, and
            control pests and weeds.
